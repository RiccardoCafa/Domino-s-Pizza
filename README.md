## welcome to the domino game made at the command prompt

This game was made by students of SENAI CIMATEC. 

Teammates: Riccardo Cafagna, Jander Silva, Miguel Falcão, Gabriel Melo e Jafe Ferreira. 
Oriented by: Márcio Soussa

It's all based on Command Line Interface written in C. 

That forced us to make and use data structure as queue, stack and list on the game core logic.

We made a simple launcher in C# using Windows Forms, that launches the game, but first you _must compile the C code and create the executable_ for each mod you want to play.

Then write the mod name you want to load and click in "MOD", or just hit play for vanilla version, it will load the Prompt Command ready to play.

*it starts on fullscreen, type CNTRL + ENTER to switch*
